Prerequisites
Building NumPy requires the following software installed:
Python 3.9.x or newer
Please note that the Python development headers also need to be installed, e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu one needs to install both python3 and python3-dev. On Windows and macOS this is normally not an issue.
Compilers
Much of NumPy is written in C and C++. You will need a C compiler that complies with the C99 standard, and a C++ compiler that complies with the C++17 standard.
